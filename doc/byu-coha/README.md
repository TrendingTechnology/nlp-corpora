Description
===========

400 million words / 107,000 texts. US, 1810-2009.
Historical change. 100x as large as next-largest historical corpus of English.
The Corpus of Historical American English (COHA) is the largest structured corpus of historical English. It is related to many other corpora of English that we have created, which offer unparalleled insight into variation in English. If you are interested in historical corpora, you might also look at our Google Books (see comparison), Hansard, and TIME corpora.
COHA contains more than 400 million words of text from the 1810s-2000s (which makes it 50-100 times as large as other comparable historical corpora of English) and the corpus is balanced by genre decade by decade. The creation of the corpus results from a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) from 2008-2010.

This corpus was acquired from Mark Davies using the above URL in April, 2018.
